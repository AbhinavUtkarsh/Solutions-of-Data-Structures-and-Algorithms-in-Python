# Solutions of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repo. contains the solutions of the exercises given in the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Python which can we found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python&qid=1593124646&sr=8-1). 

In this repo. there are 15 Jupyter files with the coded solutions to all the problems, which has been tested with appropriate data. Some of those solutions would also contain explanations regarding the question itself which might not be se apparent to a new python developer.

***Any improvement regarding the documentation or the code itself would we greatly appreciated.ðŸ’«***
